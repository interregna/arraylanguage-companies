#### Updates
If you see a company on the list that doesn't exist anymore, or does not use an array language anymore, please send a pull request with an explanation. The same goes if you're currently working at, or know a company that uses an array languages but is not on the list.

Many of these companies have some kind of array language development, but it is often in one or a few particular teams rather than company-wide.
